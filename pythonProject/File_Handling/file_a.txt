Error-prone: File handling operations in Python can be prone to errors, especially if the code is not carefully written or if there are issues with the file system (e.g. file permissions, file locks, etc.).
Security risks : File handling in Python can also pose security risks, especially if the program accepts user input that can be used to access or modify sensitive files on the system.
Complexity : File handling in Python can be complex, especially when working with more advanced file formats or operations. Careful attention must be paid to the code to ensure that files are handled properly and securely.
Performance : File handling operations in Python can be slower than other programming languages, especially when dealing with large files or performing complex operations.
